# YouTube Clone

Welcome to my YouTube clone project! This project is a reproduction of the YouTube UI (front-end) using purely HTML and CSS. 
It has been hosted and deployed using GitHub Pages for easy access.

## Features

- Pure HTML and CSS implementation
- Implementation of media queries for enhanced responsiveness across different devices
- Utilizes containerization for modular component structure
- Optimized for accessibility with semantic HTML attributes
- Uses Flexbox and Grid layout for a flexible and responsive design, ensuring optimal display on devices of different sizes
- Incorporates smooth transition animations to improve the user experience, creating seamless interactions throughout the application
- Clickable thumbnails and titles: Users can click on video thumbnails or titles to open and watch the corresponding videos
- Added tooltips: Enhance user experience with tooltips that provide additional information when hovering over buttons
- Hover over the verification check-mark badge to see a 'Verified' tooltip
- Hover over buttons across the nav-bar and header to see them transition their opacity smoothly and seamlessly
- Cross-browser compatibility for a consistent experience on various browsers
- Incorporates Absolute, Relative, and Fixed positions for elements such as tooltips and the fixed header
- Organized into multiple files, separating HTML and CSS based on different sections of the website. This modular approach enhances maintainability and makes it easier to manage and update specific components
